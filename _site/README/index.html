<p>Hi everyone! I am an aspiring student filmmaker in long need of a portfolio to showcase my work.</p>
<p>I've contemplated hosting my work using a CMS, but ultimately came to the decision that the costs of such are too high for my liking. I love learning new things and am a problem-solver by heart, so I have taken action to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript using online courses and whatnot, to build this website myself.</p>
<p>I am continuing to learn these skills and get the hang of Git/GitHub as I make changes and updates to my code, so please bear with me as I document my journey.</p>
<p>Critisms and suggestions are always welcome.</p>
